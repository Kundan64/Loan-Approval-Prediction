# Loan-Approval-Prediction

Predicting loan approvals based on applicant details using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning.

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes loan application data to identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions. Using EDA and visualization techniques, we uncover patterns in applicant demographics, financial details, and credit history.

**Objectives**

Analyze the impact of different features (income, credit history, etc.) on loan approval.
Identify trends and biases in loan approval decisions.
Build a predictive model to classify applications as approved or rejected.

**Dataset**

Source: Loan approval dataset (bank loan records)
Features: Applicant gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history, etc.
Target Variable: Loan approval status (Approved/Rejected)

**Analysis & Methodology**

Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Feature Engineering & Encoding Categorical Data
Model Selection & Performance Evaluation

**Key Findings**

Credit history is the most influential factor in loan approval.
Higher-income applicants are more likely to be approved.
Self-employed applicants have a slightly lower approval rate.
Loan amount & repayment capability affect approval chances.

**Conclusion**

The loan approval process is influenced by multiple factors, with credit history being the strongest predictor. Applicants with a stable income, lower loan amounts, and a clean credit history have a higher likelihood of approval. The analysis highlights potential biases in loan approvals, suggesting that further optimization of the decision process could improve fairness and inclusivity.
